Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.\n\nAlignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well‑ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.\n\nSize. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\nDarkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nDwarven Resilience.

You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.",

Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\n\nAlignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self‑expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos.

You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\n\nFey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.\n\nTrance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.",
