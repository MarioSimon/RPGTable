On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.\n- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n\nUnarmored Defense\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.\n\nReckless Attack\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.\n\nDanger Sense\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated\n\nPrimal Path\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n\nFast Movement\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.\n\nFeral Instinct\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\n\nBrutal Critical\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\n\nRelentless Rage\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\n\nPersistent Rage\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\n\nIndomitable Might\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\n\nPrimal Champion\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.",

That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).

Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.",

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\nSpellbook\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st‑level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\nPreparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd‑level wizard, you have four 1st‑level and two 2nd‑level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st‑level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st‑level or a 2nd‑level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).\n\nArcane Recovery\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you’re a 4th‑level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd‑level spell slot or two 1st‑level spell slots.",
